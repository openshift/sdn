preface = """\
This is the second patch release for `containerd` in the 1.0 series. There are
several fixes to reduce memory usage and garbage collection pressure in the
shim. The content store has a few fixes to address cases where download
resumption wasn't working properly. The image store has fixes to be more
efficient and to handle edge cases in the garbage collector. Less CPU will be
used when collecting cgroup metrics.

The most critical fix addresses a hang in runc that can happen due to a race
condition around FIFOs. Make sure to update your runc binary if you are
affected. The fix is described in
https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/1698. Make sure to update to the
runc version in
https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/RUNC.md to ensure you are not affected.

In addition to the above, a few fixes for handling of layer files have been backported. https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/2063
addresses an issue where duplicate directory entries can land in a layer diff
if both the metadata and a child entry are changed.
https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/2103 where whiteout files for
parent directories may be missing.

The license of the dependency `BurntSushi/toml` has been updated to an MIT
license.

We also now ensure that the vendor directory contents are as expected.
