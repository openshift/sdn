This is the first patch release for `containerd` in the 1.0 series. Several
bugfixes surrounding tar, image handling, errant log messages and resource
management are present. During the release candidate period, issues with layer
whiteout files were fixed, in addition to logic adjustements to user resolution
in OCI images.

Note the daemon no longer shuts down when failing to adjust its own OOM score.
Instead, a warning will be issued.
